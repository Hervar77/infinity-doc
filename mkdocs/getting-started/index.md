# Getting started

To start you own project based on INFINITY.JS, you will need to setup the INFINITY.JS runtime, a TypeScript compiler and a text editor or IDE - preferably with support for the typescript or at least javascript programming languages.

We'll show you how to set up your development environment and get started using the free Visual Studio Code IDE, with support for running and debugging your application from within the IDE.

- [Setup Development](setup-development.md)  
    Install and setup INFINITY.JS, the typescript compiler and the Visual Studio Code IDE.

- [Setup Project](setup-project.md)  
    Setup your project structure, with auto-compiling and running the project from within the IDE.

- [Debugging](debugging.md)  
    Run your project in a debugger from inside the IDE.

- [Package Project](package-project.md)  
    Package your project for release/distribution.
